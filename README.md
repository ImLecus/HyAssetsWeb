# HyAssetsWeb
A website for the Hyassets, a collection of 3D models by @Powerbyte7


Hey everyone! I'm Marcos Gonz√°lez (AKA Lecus), the developer behind this webpage. First of all, **I'm not the creator of the Hyassets**, all the credit is for @Powerbyte7. 

This tiny project was created using native HTML, CSS and JavaScript, without any framework or CSS preporcessor due to the simplicity of the webpage.
